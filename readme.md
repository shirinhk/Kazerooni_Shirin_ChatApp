# My live interactive Chat Application

## Creating with Node, Express and the Vue CLI with socket.io

### My New Added Functionalities : 1- Showing who is ENTERING and LEAVING the chatt room (the notification message pops up and disappear after 3 seconds). 2- Separetated messages according to sender and receiver. 3- Scrolling the chat message section automatically to allways show the new message.

## Refrences : I watched class videos couple of times and, watched all youtube tutorials! :)))
